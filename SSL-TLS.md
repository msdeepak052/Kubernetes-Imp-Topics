# 🔐 SSL & TLS – In-Depth Guide

---

## 🧭 1. What are SSL and TLS?

### 🔹 SSL – Secure Sockets Layer

* Developed by Netscape in the 1990s to secure internet communications.
* SSL went through multiple versions (1.0 to 3.0), but all have **been deprecated** due to security flaws.
* SSL provided:

  * **Encryption** of data over the network.
  * **Authentication** via certificates.
  * **Integrity** checks to ensure data is not tampered.

### 🔹 TLS – Transport Layer Security

* TLS is the **successor of SSL**, standardized by the IETF.
* Current versions: **TLS 1.2** and **TLS 1.3** (latest and most secure).
* TLS is more secure, efficient, and flexible than SSL.

> 📌 When we say “SSL”, we often mean “TLS” today in practice.

---

## ❓ 2. Why is TLS Needed?

Imagine logging into a banking website using HTTP. The browser sends your username and password in **plain text** across the internet. Any attacker listening on the network (e.g., in public Wi-Fi) can read those credentials.

TLS solves this by ensuring:

* **Confidentiality** – No one can read the data (encrypted).
* **Integrity** – Data cannot be changed in transit.
* **Authentication** – You know you're talking to the real server, not an impostor.

### 🧾 Key Problems Without TLS:

| Problem            | Consequence                                      |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Data in plain text | Hackers can read sensitive data                  |
| No authentication  | Easy for hackers to create fake sites (phishing) |
| No integrity       | Hackers can tamper with data                     |

## 🧱 3. TLS Architecture

TLS operates between the **Application Layer (HTTP)** and **Transport Layer (TCP)**.

### 🔹 Components:

1. **Client (Browser or App)** – Initiates secure communication.
2. **Server (Website or API)** – Has a TLS certificate installed.
3. **Certificate Authority (CA)** – Issues digital certificates, like a passport authority.

### 📑 TLS Certificate Includes:

* Domain name
* Public key
* Issuer (CA)
* Expiry date
* Digital signature from CA

---

## 🤝 4. TLS Handshake – Step-by-Step

The handshake is the process that sets up a secure session between the client and the server.

---

### 🔐 Step-by-Step TLS Handshake (TLS 1.2 Example)

1. **Client Hello**:

   * Client sends:

     * TLS version it supports
     * Random data
     * List of supported cipher suites (algorithms)

2. **Server Hello**:

   * Server responds with:

     * Chosen TLS version and cipher
     * Its **digital certificate** (contains public key)
     * Server random

3. **Certificate Verification**:

   * Client checks:

     * Certificate signed by a trusted CA?
     * Not expired?
     * Domain matches?

4. **Key Exchange**:

   * Client generates a **pre-master key**.
   * Encrypts it with server's public key.
   * Server uses its private key to decrypt it.

5. **Session Key Creation**:

   * Both sides generate the same **session key** using the pre-master key + random values.

6. **Secure Communication Begins**:

   * All further communication is **encrypted** using **symmetric encryption** (faster).

## 🔧 5. How to Configure TLS in Web Server (Apache Example)

### 🔨 Pre-requisites:

* You must have:

  * A **domain** (e.g., `example.com`)
  * A valid **TLS certificate** (from Let’s Encrypt, DigiCert, etc.)

---

### 🛠️ Step 1: Generate Private Key and CSR

```bash
openssl req -new -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout example.key -out example.csr
```

* `example.key`: Private key (keep this secret!)
* `example.csr`: Certificate Signing Request – Submit this to a CA.

---

### 🛠️ Step 2: Get a Certificate from a CA

Submit the `.csr` to a trusted Certificate Authority. You will receive:

* `example.crt` – Your domain's certificate
* `ca_bundle.crt` – Intermediate CA certificate

---

### 🛠️ Step 3: Configure Apache

Edit Apache configuration (`/etc/httpd/conf.d/ssl.conf` or a site-specific file):

```apache
<VirtualHost *:443>
    ServerName example.com

    SSLEngine on
    SSLCertificateFile /etc/ssl/certs/example.crt
    SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/ssl/private/example.key
    SSLCertificateChainFile /etc/ssl/certs/ca_bundle.crt

    DocumentRoot /var/www/html
</VirtualHost>
```

---

### 🛠️ Step 4: Enable SSL Module and Restart

```bash
sudo a2enmod ssl
sudo systemctl restart apache2
```

Now, access your site at `https://example.com` – it’s secured with TLS.

## 🧠 6. How Hackers Intercept Without TLS

### 🔴 A. Packet Sniffing (Wi-Fi Eavesdropping)

Using tools like:

* Wireshark
* tcpdump

Hackers can **capture and view all traffic** between a client and a server.

**Example:**

```http
GET /login HTTP/1.1
Host: insecure.com
Username: admin
Password: secret123
```

---

### 🔴 B. Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack

1. Attacker places themselves between the client and server (e.g., by creating a rogue Wi-Fi hotspot).
2. They intercept requests and responses.
3. They can:

   * Modify responses (e.g., inject malicious JavaScript)
   * Steal credentials
   * Redirect to fake login pages

**Tools Used:**

* mitmproxy
* Bettercap
* ARP spoofing tools

---

### 🔴 C. SSL Stripping Attack

* Invented by Moxie Marlinspike.
* The attacker **downgrades HTTPS to HTTP** by intercepting the redirect.

**Flow:**

1. Client requests `http://example.com`
2. Server replies with 301 → `https://example.com`
3. Attacker intercepts and **removes redirect**
4. Client continues over **HTTP**, unaware

---

## ✅ 7. How TLS Prevents These Attacks

| Threat         | How TLS Helps                                |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Eavesdropping  | Data is encrypted using session key          |
| MITM           | Server certificate proves identity           |
| Data Tampering | Message integrity check (MAC)                |
| Impersonation  | Only real servers have valid CA-signed certs |
| SSL Stripping  | Use HSTS to **enforce HTTPS**                |

---

## 🔒 8. Best Practices for TLS Configuration

| Area        | Recommendation                                                         |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Protocols   | Use only **TLS 1.2** or **TLS 1.3**                                    |
| Ciphers     | Use strong ones like AES-GCM                                           |
| HSTS        | Use `Strict-Transport-Security` header                                 |
| Certificate | Use **Let's Encrypt** or paid CA, renew regularly                      |
| Testing     | Use [SSL Labs](https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/) to test configuration |

To securely connect **`kubectl`** to the **Kubernetes API server**, **SSL/TLS** is used to:

* Encrypt communication between the client (`kubectl`) and the API server.
* Authenticate the identity of both client and server using certificates.
* Authorize access using certificates or tokens.

Let’s break it down in detail:

---

# 🔐 TLS/SSL Between `kubectl` and Kubernetes API Server

---

## 🧱 1. Components Involved

| Component                          | Role                                                                            |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `kubectl`                          | CLI tool (acts as the **client**)                                               |
| API Server                         | Kubernetes control plane endpoint                                               |
| kubeconfig file (`~/.kube/config`) | Holds cluster access information, including certificates and API server address |
| Certificates                       | Used for mutual TLS authentication (mTLS)                                       |

---

## 🔁 2. How SSL/TLS Works Between `kubectl` and API Server

### Step-by-Step TLS Flow:

1. **`kubectl` reads `kubeconfig`** file.
2. It retrieves:

   * API server endpoint (`https://<ip>:6443`)
   * CA certificate to trust the API server
   * Client certificate/key or token to authenticate
3. **Mutual TLS (mTLS) occurs**:

   * API server presents its **server certificate**.
   * `kubectl` verifies it using the **CA certificate**.
   * Optionally, API server requests client cert (mTLS).
4. If verified, a **secure connection is established**.
5. `kubectl` sends REST API calls over HTTPS.

---

## 🧾 3. Sample `kubeconfig` File with TLS

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
clusters:
- cluster:
    certificate-authority: /etc/kubernetes/pki/ca.crt     # Trusted CA
    server: https://192.168.1.100:6443                     # API server URL
  name: kubernetes
contexts:
- context:
    cluster: kubernetes
    user: kubernetes-admin
  name: kubernetes-context
current-context: kubernetes-context
kind: Config
preferences: {}
users:
- name: kubernetes-admin
  user:
    client-certificate: /etc/kubernetes/pki/admin.crt      # Client certificate
    client-key: /etc/kubernetes/pki/admin.key              # Client private key
```

### Key TLS files involved:

| File        | Purpose                                 |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `ca.crt`    | CA that signed API server’s certificate |
| `admin.crt` | Client certificate (`kubectl`)          |
| `admin.key` | Client’s private key                    |

---

## 🛠️ 4. TLS Certificate Configuration in Control Plane

Certificates are usually located in:

```
/etc/kubernetes/pki/
```

| File                      | Description                        |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `ca.crt`                  | Root certificate authority         |
| `ca.key`                  | CA's private key (kept secret!)    |
| `apiserver.crt`           | TLS certificate used by API server |
| `apiserver.key`           | Private key for API server TLS     |
| `admin.crt` / `admin.key` | Used by kubectl (via kubeconfig)   |

---

## 🔐 5. Example: Creating TLS Certs for `kubectl` (manual process)

### Step 1: Generate a key and CSR

```bash
openssl genrsa -out admin.key 2048

openssl req -new -key admin.key -out admin.csr \
  -subj "/CN=admin/O=system:masters"
```

* `CN=admin`: Common Name (identity of the user)
* `O=system:masters`: Group that grants cluster-admin rights

### Step 2: Sign CSR with Kubernetes CA

```bash
openssl x509 -req -in admin.csr -CA ca.crt -CAkey ca.key -CAcreateserial \
  -out admin.crt -days 365
```

This `admin.crt` + `admin.key` can be used in kubeconfig for secure access.

## 🛑 6. How Hackers Can Intercept If TLS is Misconfigured

### 🔴 Scenario 1: No TLS

* If Kubernetes API is served over plain HTTP, attackers can:

  * **Sniff credentials**
  * **Inject API calls**
  * **Impersonate kubectl**

### 🔴 Scenario 2: Invalid/Untrusted Certs

* If client **ignores certificate errors**, attacker can MITM:

  * Present **fake API server cert**
  * Trick `kubectl` into connecting to a rogue server

### 🔴 Scenario 3: Stolen `kubeconfig` File

* If an attacker gets access to kubeconfig with client keys:

  * They get **full access** to the cluster (if not scoped)
  * Certificates often have **long lifespans**

## 🧰 7. How to Protect the Connection

| Security Measure                 | Description                                              |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Use TLS 1.2 or 1.3               | Configure API server to reject old/insecure TLS versions |
| Strong Certificates              | Use short-lived certs with secure key size (2048+ bit)   |
| Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) | Limit what a user/certificate can do                     |
| Encrypt Secrets at Rest          | API server encrypts secrets in etcd using KMS            |
| Rotate Certificates              | Use automation to renew and rotate certs regularly       |
| Audit Logs                       | Monitor all kubectl/API activity                         |
| Don’t expose API server publicly | Use private networking or a bastion host                 |

---

## 🔍 8. Test TLS Connection from `kubectl`

### View API Server Certificate:

```bash
openssl s_client -connect <apiserver-ip>:6443 -showcerts
```

### View TLS Debug Info from `kubectl`:

```bash
KUBECONFIG=~/.kube/config kubectl get pods --v=8
```

* Shows HTTP request and TLS handshake info
