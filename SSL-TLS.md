# 🔐 SSL & TLS – In-Depth Guide

---

## 🧭 1. What are SSL and TLS?

### 🔹 SSL – Secure Sockets Layer

* Developed by Netscape in the 1990s to secure internet communications.
* SSL went through multiple versions (1.0 to 3.0), but all have **been deprecated** due to security flaws.
* SSL provided:

  * **Encryption** of data over the network.
  * **Authentication** via certificates.
  * **Integrity** checks to ensure data is not tampered.

### 🔹 TLS – Transport Layer Security

* TLS is the **successor of SSL**, standardized by the IETF.
* Current versions: **TLS 1.2** and **TLS 1.3** (latest and most secure).
* TLS is more secure, efficient, and flexible than SSL.

> 📌 When we say “SSL”, we often mean “TLS” today in practice.

## ❓ 2. Why is TLS Needed?

Imagine logging into a banking website using HTTP. The browser sends your username and password in **plain text** across the internet. Any attacker listening on the network (e.g., in public Wi-Fi) can read those credentials.

TLS solves this by ensuring:

* **Confidentiality** – No one can read the data (encrypted).
* **Integrity** – Data cannot be changed in transit.
* **Authentication** – You know you're talking to the real server, not an impostor.

### 🧾 Key Problems Without TLS:

| Problem            | Consequence                                      |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Data in plain text | Hackers can read sensitive data                  |
| No authentication  | Easy for hackers to create fake sites (phishing) |
| No integrity       | Hackers can tamper with data                     |

## 🧱 3. TLS Architecture

TLS operates between the **Application Layer (HTTP)** and **Transport Layer (TCP)**.

### 🔹 Components:

1. **Client (Browser or App)** – Initiates secure communication.
2. **Server (Website or API)** – Has a TLS certificate installed.
3. **Certificate Authority (CA)** – Issues digital certificates, like a passport authority.

### 📑 TLS Certificate Includes:

* Domain name
* Public key
* Issuer (CA)
* Expiry date
* Digital signature from CA

---

## 🤝 4. TLS Handshake – Step-by-Step

The handshake is the process that sets up a secure session between the client and the server.

### 🔐 Step-by-Step TLS Handshake (TLS 1.2 Example)

1. **Client Hello**:

   * Client sends:

     * TLS version it supports
     * Random data
     * List of supported cipher suites (algorithms)

2. **Server Hello**:

   * Server responds with:

     * Chosen TLS version and cipher
     * Its **digital certificate** (contains public key)
     * Server random

3. **Certificate Verification**:

   * Client checks:

     * Certificate signed by a trusted CA?
     * Not expired?
     * Domain matches?

4. **Key Exchange**:

   * Client generates a **pre-master key**.
   * Encrypts it with server's public key.
   * Server uses its private key to decrypt it.

5. **Session Key Creation**:

   * Both sides generate the same **session key** using the pre-master key + random values.

6. **Secure Communication Begins**:

   * All further communication is **encrypted** using **symmetric encryption** (faster).

## 🔧 5. How to Configure TLS in Web Server (Apache Example)

### 🔨 Pre-requisites:

* You must have:

  * A **domain** (e.g., `example.com`)
  * A valid **TLS certificate** (from Let’s Encrypt, DigiCert, etc.)

---

### 🛠️ Step 1: Generate Private Key and CSR

```bash
openssl req -new -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout example.key -out example.csr
```

* `example.key`: Private key (keep this secret!)
* `example.csr`: Certificate Signing Request – Submit this to a CA.

---

### 🛠️ Step 2: Get a Certificate from a CA

Submit the `.csr` to a trusted Certificate Authority. You will receive:

* `example.crt` – Your domain's certificate
* `ca_bundle.crt` – Intermediate CA certificate

---

### 🛠️ Step 3: Configure Apache

Edit Apache configuration (`/etc/httpd/conf.d/ssl.conf` or a site-specific file):

```apache
<VirtualHost *:443>
    ServerName example.com

    SSLEngine on
    SSLCertificateFile /etc/ssl/certs/example.crt
    SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/ssl/private/example.key
    SSLCertificateChainFile /etc/ssl/certs/ca_bundle.crt

    DocumentRoot /var/www/html
</VirtualHost>
```

---

### 🛠️ Step 4: Enable SSL Module and Restart

```bash
sudo a2enmod ssl
sudo systemctl restart apache2
```

Now, access your site at `https://example.com` – it’s secured with TLS.

## 🧠 6. How Hackers Intercept Without TLS

### 🔴 A. Packet Sniffing (Wi-Fi Eavesdropping)

Using tools like:

* Wireshark
* tcpdump

Hackers can **capture and view all traffic** between a client and a server.

**Example:**

```http
GET /login HTTP/1.1
Host: insecure.com
Username: admin
Password: secret123
```

---

### 🔴 B. Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack

1. Attacker places themselves between the client and server (e.g., by creating a rogue Wi-Fi hotspot).
2. They intercept requests and responses.
3. They can:

   * Modify responses (e.g., inject malicious JavaScript)
   * Steal credentials
   * Redirect to fake login pages

**Tools Used:**

* mitmproxy
* Bettercap
* ARP spoofing tools

---

### 🔴 C. SSL Stripping Attack

* Invented by Moxie Marlinspike.
* The attacker **downgrades HTTPS to HTTP** by intercepting the redirect.

**Flow:**

1. Client requests `http://example.com`
2. Server replies with 301 → `https://example.com`
3. Attacker intercepts and **removes redirect**
4. Client continues over **HTTP**, unaware

## ✅ 7. How TLS Prevents These Attacks

| Threat         | How TLS Helps                                |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Eavesdropping  | Data is encrypted using session key          |
| MITM           | Server certificate proves identity           |
| Data Tampering | Message integrity check (MAC)                |
| Impersonation  | Only real servers have valid CA-signed certs |
| SSL Stripping  | Use HSTS to **enforce HTTPS**                |

## 🔒 8. Best Practices for TLS Configuration

| Area        | Recommendation                                                         |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Protocols   | Use only **TLS 1.2** or **TLS 1.3**                                    |
| Ciphers     | Use strong ones like AES-GCM                                           |
| HSTS        | Use `Strict-Transport-Security` header                                 |
| Certificate | Use **Let's Encrypt** or paid CA, renew regularly                      |
| Testing     | Use [SSL Labs](https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/) to test configuration |
