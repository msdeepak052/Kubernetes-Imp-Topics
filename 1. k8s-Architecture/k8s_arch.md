#### Let‚Äôs go **deep dive** into the **Kubernetes architecture** and **exact internal flow** of what happens when you run:

```bash
kubectl apply -f abc.yaml
```

We‚Äôll go in layers, like peeling an onion ‚Äî each layer of the architecture, and what happens inside the cluster **step by step**, in **detailed chronological order**.

---

## üß† PART 1: Kubernetes Architecture ‚Äì Complete Internals

---

### üìç **A. Control Plane Components (Master Node)**

These manage **what should happen** in the cluster. These don't run your application containers ‚Äî they run the **brains of Kubernetes**.

#### 1. **kube-apiserver**

* Entry point for **all cluster operations**.
* Accepts REST calls (`kubectl`, dashboard, etc.).
* Validates and processes API requests.
* Persists the state in **etcd**.
* Sends back the response to clients.
* Everything goes through this ‚Äî no component talks to each other **directly** except via the API server.

#### 2. **etcd**

* A distributed **key-value store**.
* Maintains the **state of the cluster**:

  * What nodes exist?
  * What Pods should run?
  * ConfigMaps, Secrets, Deployments, etc.
* Highly available and consistent ‚Äî uses the **Raft consensus algorithm**.
* Example stored value:

  ```json
  /namespaces/default/deployments/myapp ‚Üí spec: { replicas: 3, image: "nginx" }
  ```

#### 3. **kube-scheduler**

* Watches for **unassigned Pods** (`Pending` state) via the API Server.
* Decides:

  * Which node has **enough resources** (CPU/mem)?
  * Does it match **affinity/anti-affinity**, **taints**, **labels**?
* Makes a binding between the Pod and Node.
* Example: ‚ÄúPod `myapp-1234` should run on `worker-node-2`.‚Äù

#### 4. **kube-controller-manager**

* Runs many controllers as loops (think of them as **watchdogs**):

  * **ReplicaSet Controller** ‚Üí Ensures correct number of Pods.
  * **Node Controller** ‚Üí Monitors health of nodes.
  * **Deployment Controller** ‚Üí Handles rolling updates/rollbacks.
  * **Service Account & Token Controllers**, etc.
* These keep **observing etcd** (desired state), comparing with **actual state**, and triggering changes to bring them in sync.

---

### üìç **B. Worker Node Components**

These nodes run your actual application **containers** (Pods).

#### 1. **kubelet**

* Runs on each node.
* Talks to API server and checks:

  > "What Pods should I run here?"
* Uses **PodSpec** to start containers via the container runtime.
* Continuously reports the **health status** of running Pods to API server.
* If a container crashes, kubelet restarts it.

#### 2. **container runtime**

* The actual engine that runs containers.
* Could be:

  * Docker (deprecated)
  * containerd (most common)
  * CRI-O
* Pulls images from registry, manages lifecycle.

#### 3. **kube-proxy**

* Maintains network rules (iptables/ipvs) on the node.
* Forwards traffic to the correct Pod behind a Service.
* Handles:

  * ClusterIP
  * LoadBalancer
  * NodePort

## üöÄ PART 2: What Happens When You Run `kubectl apply -f abc.yaml`

Let‚Äôs break this down into the **full internal chain reaction** inside Kubernetes:

---

### ‚úÖ Step 1: `kubectl` sends the API request

* `kubectl`:

  * Reads the `abc.yaml` file.
  * Validates the schema (if possible).
  * Converts it to a RESTful HTTP request.
  * Sends it to the `kube-apiserver`.

Example request:

```http
POST /apis/apps/v1/namespaces/default/deployments
Content-Type: application/json
Body: { ... contents of abc.yaml ... }
```

* If `abc.yaml` is a `Deployment`, it ends up calling the `Deployment` API.

---

### ‚úÖ Step 2: API Server processes the request

* Checks for:

  * **Authentication**: Is the user allowed?
  * **Authorization (RBAC)**: Can the user create Deployments?
  * **Admission Controllers**: Are there any policies (e.g., no image\:latest)?
* Then:

  * Stores the `Deployment` definition into `etcd` (desired state).

**etcd entry example**:

```json
/deployments/default/myapp ‚Üí { replicas: 3, image: "nginx" }
```

This means: *‚ÄúI want 3 pods of nginx running.‚Äù*

---

### ‚úÖ Step 3: Deployment Controller kicks in

* The **Deployment Controller**, running inside the Controller Manager, detects a new `Deployment` object.
* It generates a **ReplicaSet** object based on the template inside `abc.yaml`.
* ReplicaSet is created with desired replicas = 3.

**Creates:**

```yaml
kind: ReplicaSet
metadata:
  name: myapp-rs-1
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector: matchLabels: app=myapp
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: nginx
          image: nginx:1.21
```

---

### ‚úÖ Step 4: ReplicaSet Controller creates Pods

* The **ReplicaSet Controller** compares:

  > Desired: 3 Pods
  > Actual: 0 Pods

* It creates **3 Pod objects** in `etcd` with:

  * `Pending` status
  * No node assigned yet

---

### ‚úÖ Step 5: Scheduler assigns Pods to Nodes

* Scheduler sees new unassigned Pods.
* For each Pod:

  * Finds an eligible node (enough CPU/mem, label match, tolerations, etc.).
  * Binds the Pod to a node:

    ```yaml
    spec:
      nodeName: worker-node-2
    ```
  * Updates the Pod‚Äôs status in `etcd`.

---

### ‚úÖ Step 6: kubelet receives the instruction

* The kubelet on `worker-node-2` polls the API server:

  > "Oh, I have to run Pod `myapp-abc123`."

* It takes the PodSpec and:

  * Pulls the container image (e.g., nginx:1.21).
  * Creates the container using `containerd`.
  * Mounts volumes, sets up networking, etc.

* Once started, kubelet updates the Pod status as `Running`.

---

### ‚úÖ Step 7: kube-proxy sets up Service networking

* If your yaml has a `Service` object:

  ```yaml
  kind: Service
  spec:
    type: ClusterIP
    selector:
      app: myapp
    ports:
      - port: 80
  ```

* Then kube-proxy:

  * Sets up iptables rules to route traffic to the backend Pods.
  * Exposes the service to the cluster.

---

### ‚úÖ Step 8: Monitoring and Healing begins

From this point forward:

* **If Pod crashes** ‚Üí kubelet restarts it.
* **If Node goes down** ‚Üí controller re-schedules the Pod.
* **If you run `kubectl rollout restart deployment myapp`** ‚Üí Deployment controller rolls out new Pods with zero downtime.

## üîÅ If You Later Run `kubectl apply -f abc.yaml` Again?

* It will:

  * Compare existing spec with new one.
  * If same ‚Üí does nothing.
  * If different (e.g., image change) ‚Üí triggers a rolling update.
