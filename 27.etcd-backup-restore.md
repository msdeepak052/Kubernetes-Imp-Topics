# ETCD backup and restore

Let’s go step-by-step and cover:
1️⃣ What etcd is and why it’s important
2️⃣ Why we need backup and restore
3️⃣ How backup and restore work (concept + commands)
4️⃣ What is actually captured in the backup
5️⃣ Common CKA-related scenarios

---

## 🧠 1. What is etcd?

* **etcd** is a **key-value store** used by Kubernetes to store all **cluster state and configuration data**.
* It’s like the **brain of your cluster** — everything about nodes, pods, secrets, configmaps, deployments, RBAC, and more lives here.
* If etcd is lost, **the entire cluster state is gone**, even if worker nodes are still running.

### Example:

When you run:

```bash
kubectl get pods -A
```

→ The API Server retrieves data from etcd.

---

## ⚠️ 2. Why Backup and Restore are Required

* To **recover the cluster** in case of:

  * etcd data corruption
  * control-plane node failure
  * accidental deletion of cluster objects
  * etcd upgrade/migration issues
* Backup ensures **cluster state consistency** and allows restoring to a known good point.

### Real-world Example:

If an admin accidentally deletes all namespaces except `kube-system`, restoring from an etcd snapshot brings back the full previous state.

---

## 🧩 3. How Backup and Restore Work

### 🗂 Backup = Snapshot of etcd database

#### ✅ Step 1: Identify etcd pod

In most clusters:

```bash
kubectl get pods -n kube-system
```

Example:

```
etcd-controlplane
```

#### ✅ Step 2: Get etcd container details

```bash
kubectl -n kube-system exec etcd-controlplane -- etcdctl version
```

#### ✅ Step 3: Run snapshot save command

Inside the control-plane (or directly via SSH):

```bash
ETCDCTL_API=3 etcdctl \
  --endpoints=https://127.0.0.1:2379 \
  --cacert=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/ca.crt \
  --cert=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/server.crt \
  --key=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/server.key \
  snapshot save /opt/etcd-backup.db
```

**Output:**

```
Snapshot saved at /opt/etcd-backup.db
```

You can verify:

```bash
ETCDCTL_API=3 etcdctl snapshot status /opt/etcd-backup.db
```

---

### 🔄 Restore = Rebuild etcd from the snapshot

#### ✅ Step 1: Stop kube-apiserver (to prevent writes)

* In a kubeadm cluster, **control plane components (kube-apiserver, kube-controller-manager, kube-scheduler, etcd)** run as **static pods**, **not systemd services**.
* That means there is **no `kube-apiserver.service`**, so `systemctl` can’t stop it.

You can verify:

```bash
ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver
```

or

```bash
kubectl get pods -n kube-system -o wide | grep kube-apiserver
```

You’ll see it’s running as a **pod**, managed by **kubelet**.

---

## ** How to stop kube-apiserver (or other control plane components)**

Since they are **static pods**, you stop them by **stopping kubelet**:

```bash
sudo systemctl stop kubelet
```

* This stops all control plane components temporarily.
* After your restore is done, start kubelet again:

```bash
sudo systemctl start kubelet
```

* kubelet will automatically start the static pods again from `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/`.

---

## **3️⃣ Key points for CKA**

* **Static pods** are stored in `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/`.
* You **never use systemctl** for individual components on a kubeadm cluster.
* To simulate downtime for etcd restore, **stop kubelet**, replace etcd data, then **start kubelet**.



#### ✅ Step 2: Restore snapshot to a new directory

```bash
ETCDCTL_API=3 etcdctl snapshot restore /opt/etcd-backup.db \
  --data-dir /var/lib/etcd-restore
```

#### ✅ Step 3: Update etcd configuration

Edit `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/etcd.yaml`:

```yaml
- --data-dir=/var/lib/etcd-restore
```

Then kubelet will automatically restart the etcd pod using the new data directory.

#### ✅ Step 4: Verify cluster state

Once the control plane is back up:

```bash
kubectl get pods -A
```

You should see your old state restored.

## 📦 4. What is Included in etcd Backup

The etcd snapshot contains **the entire cluster state**, including:

| Type                  | Examples                                      |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Cluster Configuration | Nodes, Namespaces, Deployments                |
| Security              | Secrets, ServiceAccounts, Roles, RoleBindings |
| Network               | Services, Endpoints, Network Policies         |
| Custom Resources      | CRDs, Custom Objects                          |
| Storage Metadata      | PVs, PVCs (metadata only, *not* actual data)  |

> **Note:** PV data (like actual files in NFS, EBS, etc.) must be backed up separately.

---

## 💡 5. CKA Exam Tip — Common Scenarios

### 🧩 Scenario 1: Take snapshot of etcd

> “Take an etcd backup and store it at `/opt/snapshot-pre-restore.db`.”

**Solution:**

```bash
ETCDCTL_API=3 etcdctl \
  --endpoints=https://127.0.0.1:2379 \
  --cacert=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/ca.crt \
  --cert=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/server.crt \
  --key=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/server.key \
  snapshot save /opt/snapshot-pre-restore.db
```

### 🧩 Scenario 2: Restore etcd from a snapshot

> “Restore etcd from snapshot `/opt/snapshot-pre-restore.db`.”

**Solution:**

```bash
systemctl stop kube-apiserver
ETCDCTL_API=3 etcdctl snapshot restore /opt/snapshot-pre-restore.db \
  --data-dir /var/lib/etcd-from-backup
# edit etcd.yaml to point data-dir to /var/lib/etcd-from-backup
# kubelet auto-restarts etcd
```

### 🧩 Scenario 3: Verify snapshot content

```bash
ETCDCTL_API=3 etcdctl snapshot status /opt/snapshot-pre-restore.db
```

---

Let’s now go **step-by-step exactly as we’ll do it in the CKA exam**, using a **kubeadm-based control plane node** where etcd runs as a static pod.

We’ll simulate both **backup** and **restore** from start to finish.

---

## 🧱 Scenario Overview

**Goal:**
Take an etcd backup and then restore it on the same control-plane node.

**Cluster Type:** Kubeadm-based single control plane.
**Pod:** `etcd-controlplane` (name may vary slightly, e.g., `etcd-master` or `etcd-<hostname>`).

---

## ⚙️ Step 1: Get into Control Plane Node

In CKA exam, you’ll typically be told:

> “Perform the task on controlplane node.”

Switch to it:

```bash
ssh controlplane
```

Or, if already on it:

```bash
hostname
```

You should see something like `controlplane`.

---

## 🧩 Step 2: Locate etcd Pod and Certificates

Run:

```bash
kubectl get pods -n kube-system | grep etcd
```

Example output:

```
etcd-controlplane   1/1   Running   0   3d5h
```

Now get details of etcd manifest file:

```bash
cat /etc/kubernetes/manifests/etcd.yaml | grep "\-\-"
```

Look for:

```
--cert-file=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/server.crt
--key-file=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/server.key
--trusted-ca-file=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/ca.crt
--data-dir=/var/lib/etcd
```

---

## 💾 Step 3: Take etcd Backup (Snapshot)

Run from control plane node shell:

```bash
export ETCDCTL_API=3
etcdctl snapshot save /opt/etcd-backup.db \
  --endpoints=https://127.0.0.1:2379 \
  --cacert=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/ca.crt \
  --cert=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/server.crt \
  --key=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/server.key
```

✅ Output:

```
Snapshot saved at /opt/etcd-backup.db
```

---

## 🔍 Step 4: Verify Snapshot File

Check its metadata:

```bash
etcdctl snapshot status /opt/etcd-backup.db -w table
```

Expected output:

```
+----------+----------+------------+------------+
|  TOTAL   | HASH     | REVISION   |  SIZE      |
+----------+----------+------------+------------+
|    1234  | abcd123  |  100       |  3.1 MB    |
+----------+----------+------------+------------+
```

This confirms the snapshot is valid.

---

## 🧨 Step 5: Simulate Data Loss (Optional Demo)

Let’s pretend something was deleted:

```bash
kubectl delete namespace dev
```

or

```bash
kubectl delete pod nginx -n default
```

---

## 🧰 Step 6: Restore the etcd from Backup

1️⃣ **Stop kube-apiserver** to avoid new writes:

```bash
systemctl stop kube-apiserver
```

2️⃣ **Restore snapshot to a new data directory:**

```bash
export ETCDCTL_API=3
etcdctl snapshot restore /opt/etcd-backup.db \
  --data-dir /var/lib/etcd-from-backup
  
```

Output:

```
{"level":"info","msg":"restoring snapshot","path":"/opt/etcd-backup.db"}
```

---

## 🧾 Step 7: Point etcd Pod to Restored Data

Edit static pod manifest:

```bash
vi /etc/kubernetes/manifests/etcd.yaml
```

Find the line:

```
--data-dir=/var/lib/etcd
```

Change it to:

```
--data-dir=/var/lib/etcd-from-backup
```

And in volumes and volumemounts as well

Save and exit.
📌 **Kubelet automatically detects the change** and restarts the etcd pod using the new directory.

---

## 🚀 Step 8: Verify Restore

Once etcd and kube-apiserver pods are running again, check:

```bash
kubectl get pods -A
```

You should see the cluster state as it was at the backup time — e.g., deleted namespaces or pods reappear.

---

## 🧭 Step 9: (Optional) Restart kube-apiserver Manually if Needed

If it didn’t auto-start:

```bash
systemctl start kube-apiserver
```

---

## ✅ Step 10: Confirm Cluster Health

```bash
kubectl get nodes
kubectl get pods -A
```

And check etcd cluster health:

```bash
etcdctl endpoint health \
  --endpoints=https://127.0.0.1:2379 \
  --cacert=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/ca.crt \
  --cert=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/server.crt \
  --key=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/server.key
```

Output:

```
https://127.0.0.1:2379 is healthy
```
