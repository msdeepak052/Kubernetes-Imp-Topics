# Pod Termination

When you run:

```bash
kubectl delete pod <pod-name>
```

here‚Äôs exactly what happens, step by step:

---

### 1. **API Request to Kubernetes**

* `kubectl` sends a **DELETE request** to the Kubernetes **API server** for the specified Pod.
* The request looks like:

  ```
  DELETE /api/v1/namespaces/<namespace>/pods/<pod-name>
  ```

---

### 2. **Pod Deletion Process Begins**

* Kubernetes **marks the Pod for deletion**. It sets the Pod‚Äôs `deletionTimestamp`.
* The Pod **enters `Terminating` state**.
* The Pod is **not immediately removed**; first, the system tries to gracefully shut down its containers.

---

### 3. **Graceful Termination**

* Kubernetes sends a **SIGTERM signal** to each container inside the Pod.
* Containers are given a **grace period** (default 30 seconds, configurable via `--grace-period` or Pod spec `terminationGracePeriodSeconds`) to clean up resources and exit gracefully.
* During this period, Kubernetes keeps the Pod visible in `kubectl get pods` with the status `Terminating`.

---

### 4. **Forceful Termination (if needed)**

* If containers **don‚Äôt exit within the grace period**, Kubernetes sends a **SIGKILL signal**, forcibly killing the containers.

---

### 5. **Cleanup**

* Once containers stop:

  * Kubernetes **removes the Pod from etcd** (the cluster state storage).
  * Any associated resources like **volumes** are unmounted/deallocated.
  * The Pod is **deleted from the cluster**, and `kubectl get pods` no longer lists it.

---

### 6. **Impact on ReplicaSets/Deployments**

* If the Pod is **managed by a Deployment, ReplicaSet, or StatefulSet**, Kubernetes sees that the **desired number of replicas is not met**.
* It **automatically creates a new Pod** to maintain the desired state.

---

### üîπ Optional Flags

* `--grace-period=0 --force`: Deletes the Pod **immediately**, skipping graceful shutdown.
* `--wait=false`: Don‚Äôt wait for deletion to complete; `kubectl` returns immediately.

---

**In short:**
`kubectl delete pod` initiates a controlled shutdown and removal of the Pod. For managed Pods, it triggers a replacement to maintain the declared state.

# Restart Policy

In Kubernetes, the **Restart Policy** defines **how containers in a Pod should be restarted** when they exit. This is a **Pod-level setting**, not per container. Let‚Äôs break it down clearly:

---

## 1. **Where It‚Äôs Defined**

The restart policy is specified in the Pod spec:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: example-pod
spec:
  restartPolicy: <Policy>
  containers:
    - name: nginx
      image: nginx
```

---

## 2. **Possible Values**

### a) **Always** (Default for Deployments)

* **Behavior:** The container is restarted **every time it exits**, regardless of exit status.
* **Use case:** Long-running services (e.g., web servers, databases).
* **Example:**
  If Nginx crashes, Kubernetes will immediately restart it.

---

### b) **OnFailure**

* **Behavior:** The container is restarted **only if it exits with a non-zero status** (failure).
* **Use case:** Batch jobs or tasks that might fail and need retrying.
* **Example:**
  A script that processes files; if it fails, Kubernetes restarts it.

---

### c) **Never**

* **Behavior:** The container is **never restarted**, regardless of exit status.
* **Use case:** Run-once jobs where failure should not trigger retries.
* **Example:**
  A Pod that runs a database migration script once and then exits.

---

## 3. **Important Notes**

* **Deployments / ReplicaSets** always effectively have `restartPolicy: Always`, because they manage Pods and try to keep them running.
* **Jobs / CronJobs** usually use `restartPolicy: OnFailure` or `Never`.
* **RestartPolicy only applies to containers inside a Pod**, not Pods themselves.
* Changing a Pod‚Äôs restart policy **after creation is not allowed**. You must create a new Pod spec.

---

### 4. **Visual Summary**

| Restart Policy | Container Exit | Restarted? | Typical Use Case            |
| -------------- | -------------- | ---------- | --------------------------- |
| Always         | 0 or >0        | Yes        | Long-running services       |
| OnFailure      | 0              | No         | Batch jobs (success ‚Üí stop) |
| OnFailure      | >0             | Yes        | Retry on failure            |
| Never          | 0 or >0        | No         | Run-once jobs or scripts    |

Excellent question, Deepak üëè ‚Äî understanding **`imagePullPolicy`** is crucial for controlling how Kubernetes pulls container images from registries. Let‚Äôs go step by step.

---

# üß† What is `imagePullPolicy`?

`imagePullPolicy` defines **when Kubernetes should pull (download)** the container image from a container registry (like Docker Hub, ECR, ACR, etc.) before starting a Pod.

It‚Äôs specified **per container** inside the Pod spec.

---

### üìÑ Example Pod Spec

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginx-pod
spec:
  containers:
    - name: nginx
      image: nginx:latest
      imagePullPolicy: Always
```

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Valid Values of `imagePullPolicy`

| Value            | Meaning                                                                          | When to Use                                                                            |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Always**       | Always pulls the image from the registry before starting the container.          | When you want to ensure you‚Äôre using the latest version of an image tag like `latest`. |
| **IfNotPresent** | Pulls the image **only if it‚Äôs not already present** on the node.                | To reduce network usage and speed up Pod startup for fixed versions.                   |
| **Never**        | **Never pulls** the image from the registry ‚Äî it must already exist on the node. | For air-gapped or offline clusters, or when using pre-loaded images.                   |

---

## üß© Default Behavior

Kubernetes automatically sets the `imagePullPolicy` based on the **image tag**:

| Image Tag Used             | Default `imagePullPolicy` | Example                                                           |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Tag = `:latest`            | `Always`                  | `nginx:latest` ‚Üí Always pulls                                     |
| Tag specified (not latest) | `IfNotPresent`            | `nginx:1.25` ‚Üí Pulls if not present                               |
| No tag given               | `IfNotPresent`            | `nginx` ‚Üí Treated as `nginx:latest`, but policy is `IfNotPresent` |

> üß† Tip: If you specify `:latest`, it *forces* a pull every time ‚Äî this can slow startup and cause inconsistencies.

---

## üöÄ Real-World Examples

### ‚úÖ Example 1 ‚Äî Always Pull Latest Image

```yaml
containers:
  - name: web
    image: myrepo/myapp:latest
    imagePullPolicy: Always
```

‚û°Ô∏è Each time the Pod starts, it pulls the latest version of `myapp:latest`.

---

### ‚úÖ Example 2 ‚Äî Use Cached Image if Available

```yaml
containers:
  - name: backend
    image: myrepo/backend:v1.0.0
    imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
```

‚û°Ô∏è Kubernetes uses the local cached image if already present.
If not found, it pulls from the registry.

---

### ‚úÖ Example 3 ‚Äî Never Pull

```yaml
containers:
  - name: job
    image: localregistry/internal-job:v2
    imagePullPolicy: Never
```

‚û°Ô∏è Kubernetes will **not pull** the image even if it‚Äôs missing.
If the image isn‚Äôt preloaded on the node ‚Üí Pod will fail with `ImagePullBackOff`.

---

## üß∞ Image Pull Secrets (Optional)

If your image is in a **private registry**, you must configure:

```yaml
spec:
  imagePullSecrets:
    - name: myregistry-secret
```

This secret stores Docker registry credentials.

## üîç Common Issues

| Error              | Cause                                   |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| `ImagePullBackOff` | Image not found or invalid credentials. |
| Slow Pod startup   | Using `Always` unnecessarily.           |
| Old image used     | Cached image + `IfNotPresent` policy.   |

---

## üèÅ Summary Table

| imagePullPolicy  | Pull Behavior         | Best Used For                          |
| ---------------- | --------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **Always**       | Always pulls          | Dev/test environments, CI/CD pipelines |
| **IfNotPresent** | Pulls only if missing | Production (stable versions)           |
| **Never**        | Never pulls           | Air-gapped or preloaded nodes          |
